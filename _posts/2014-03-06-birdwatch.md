This morning, as I stood in the garden waiting for a mechanical carriage to take me to a mechanical tube to tranport me to a mechanical city, I noticed my hearing had changed. Automatically, magically, I picked up multiple bird songs from the trees and hedgerows. Chaffinch, blackbird, greenfinch. Streams of avian poetry peppered with feathery beats. My heart beating, my breath mixing with the air, and a sense that I was almost in touch with the endless cyclic pulse of natural reality. Being in the woods in an engaged state does things to you. Unwraps you. 

Every month I come back from the woods and grieve. But every month the woods come with me and shower my soul with dark gifts.
