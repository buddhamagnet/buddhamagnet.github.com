I'm going to be making heavy use of all manner of knives, axes, saws and similar tools over the next two years as I plunge into the woods. Tonight I took care of my [Gransfors Bruk](http://www.gransforsbruk.com/en/) wildlife hatchet. A little WD40 for the bit and some boiled linseed oil for the helve. Then I look on line for some sharpening tips and look
who I find.
