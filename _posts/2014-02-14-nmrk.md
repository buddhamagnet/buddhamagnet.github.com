I've recently started practising Japanese Buddhism again. This is not a blog about Buddhism, there are [much richer resources](http://sgi-uk.org/) around, but I was at our base in Taplow Court recently and the sound and force of several hundred
people chanting was too powerful to resist, so I recorded it. It sounds like the soul of mankind levitating.
