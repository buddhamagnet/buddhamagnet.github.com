Today was the first day this year that spring seemed possible. The snowdrops
have appeared by the front door, and there's a small splash of yellow from
the daffodils. The sky was blue so we spent the whole day in the garden. Repairing fences, raking out weed and moss, placing seed balls for the birds and watching our children whoop and whirl, covered in dirt and blissfully happy. Our family is happiest outside. I hung the hammock up to
give it an airing and engaged in some serious saw action with the dormant
cherry blossom, paring down deadwood. I let that glorious feeling of fresh
air, physical activity and soulful goodness that comes from tending the earth percolate through me. We're so fortunate to have this bounty.
