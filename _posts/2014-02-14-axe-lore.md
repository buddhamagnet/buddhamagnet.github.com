This is my Gr채nsfors Bruk wildlife hatchet. Made my hand in a forge in the North of Sweden. A great little axe. Compact, portable and perfect for lomg weekends in the woods. Every axe comes with a 20 year guarantee and the initials of the maker are stamped on the bit. Mine was made by Mattias Mattsson, one of only 30 people who work at the hundred year old business located in Nothern H채lsingland.

They make a large range of axes. I'd like to buy them all. In an age of waste and conspicuous consumption, they stand tall as purveyors of fine craft and pride. In their own words, from the axe book that comes with every tool:

"What we take, how and what we make, what we waste, is in fact a question of ethics".

H채pnadsv채ckande.
