In a week I re-commence my wild journey on the two year bushcraft course run by the incredible team at [Woodland Ways](http://woodland-ways.co.uk).

This course is pretty unique. Over the course of a couple of years, mainly
based in a 250 acre private woodland south of Oxford, you have a change to
learn a wide range of bushcraft and wilderness skills, taught by the best.

So I'm packing, and I imagine the site is pretty much underwater right now. I try to pack light, but there's always more to carry when it's wet. And boy will it be wet. So far I'm packing my trusty wildlife hatchet, a [Mora
knife](http://www.woodland-ways.co.uk/buy-online-mora-clipper-knife-860mg-(formally-frost)-80.html) ,sharpening stones for both (DC3 for the knife, Gr√§nsfors' own axe stone for the hatchet). Wouldn't normally take stones but the initial weekend is all about blades. Also a [Bahco saw](http://www.woodland-ways.co.uk/buy-online-bahco-laplander-saw-106.html), whistle, fire steel, hipflask, Stanley thermos, large and small tarp to go above the [Snugpak Ionosphere](http://www.woodland-ways.co.uk/buy-online-snugpack-ionosphere-modular-tentbivvi-664.html) modular tent.

I'm toying with the idea of taking the [Hennessy Hammock](http://www.woodland-ways.co.uk/buy-online-hennesy-hammock-expedition-asym-44.html) - but it may be too cold and I don't have an underquilt or similar insulation to prevent cold backside syndrome.

For a sleeping bag I'm taking an [Aplkit Skyehigh](https://www.alpkit.com/products/skyehigh-600) three season with a silk liner and
Thermarest mat for comfort and insulation. And some [Fjallraven](http://www.woodland-ways.co.uk/buy-online-fjallraven-barents-trousers-tarmac-447.html) bush trousers.

And of course you need to look after your feet. These [Zamberlan Vioz GT](http://www.outdoorgb.com/p/zamberlan_vioz_gt_mountain_trekking_boots_996/?utm_source=froogle&utm_medium=directory&utm_content=GBR&currency=GBP&country=GBR&SelectedBundle=148147&gclid=CK3b4KrEy7wCFbPItAodtD0ANQ) boots are incredible. A little pricey but a total investment.

Now, I just need to find some decent whisky to put in that hipflask.
