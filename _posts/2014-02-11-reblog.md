This year I made a deep and reverberating determination to reconnect with the wild. Ostensibly, this means getting into the wilds in a literal sense, into the forests and lakes, to camp, fish, make fire and use the kind of primitive tools that have served mankind well for
thousands of years.

But this surface quest has a more symbolic parallel. I work in a huge
and overbearing city, make my living wielding cutting edge digital tools, in world where software is rapidly shredding society. In many ways disruption and innovation are a good thing, but
the magnified tendency of geeks towards insularity, arrogance and conceit alarms me greatly.

So I will plumb the depths of my soul and planet, let the great electric fire of language vault through me, open my eyes and mind as
wide as they will go, connect to the most ancient and persistent
tropes of humanity in order to gain hope that hope is not lost.

And I'll aim to bring some of that hope and wisdom back, find new ways
to re-energise the shamanic impulse and explore new connections between space and time, man and machine, planet and mind.

Then again, I may just chop up some wood and set fire to stuff.
