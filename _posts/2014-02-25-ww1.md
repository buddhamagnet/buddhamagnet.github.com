This weekend I picked up the Woodland Wayer course again, having had to pull out last year. I started again, at the beginning, but that glorious 250 acre wood in the
rolling Oxfordshire countryside, with its birch and ash, hazel and hawthorne, deer
spotting posts and thick bracken, felt like home.

The weekend revolved around knives and axes - legal matters, use and care of the tools and a variety of carving projects. Two hours into the course and we were
already stripping bark from a silver birch. The weekend passed like a dream as
my heart and body reconnected with the woodland. A gradual increase in birdsong
and territorial sonics as spring approached. The drilling of a woodpecker in the
morning, wren song exploding from the hedgerows. And a tawny owl, confused by the
sudden alternations in the weather, hooting in broad daylight.

It was magical to get a bivvy tent up and meet a new group of people, drawn from
all walks of life but connected by a shared desire to live and breathe these woods, if only for a few days each month. Moments stand out in the lost hours - sitting
around the fire into the night carving spoons and talking. Fashioning mallets from
logs and taking them to knives to batton wood. Making feather sticks for the fire. Taking a late night walk and suprising some roe deer. Meeting old friends from the
first Woodland Wayer course and seeing how they've grown, how they've been changed
by immersion in this ancient and vibrating landscape.

I was tired, truly battered on my way home. On public transport, dirty and content.
When I got to my local train station I realised I had left my bank card at home and couldn't contact my wife. I shouldered my pack and walked the four miles home. And as I walked through the heath towards my house, I smiled as a single deer stepped into the road in front of me. If I had taken a taxi I wouldn't have seen it. A final
gift, a spirit guide, just for me.

I can't wait to go back.
