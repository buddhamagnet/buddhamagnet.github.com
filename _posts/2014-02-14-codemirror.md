Programmers (in some circles) love to argue about aesthetics in code. To some, the code is just a set of instructions for the machine - it doesn't
matter how ugly or noisy the code is so long as it does the job in the most
efficient way possible. To some, code is meant for humans. At the extreme, I
have heard it described as storytelling for machines. My favourite programming language is Ruby, a language invented in Japan and, in the words
of its creator, optimised for programmer happiness. The community around the
language is characterised by an intense focus on innovation and there is a tendency towards language games, puns and off-kilter poetry that suckers me
in every time, for good or bad. I guess it's a way for the writer in me to
plug into the energy fields that give me life as I plug away at the terminal.

This is not a programming blog, but it would be an interesting exercise to post some samples of code side by side and see what tone or effect is generated in the mind of the reader. Doesn't matter what the languages are,
I'm after instinctual reactions to space, elegance and form.

{% highlight ruby %}
%w[dave has too much time].each do |word|
  puts word
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
li = ['a', 'b', 'e']
for s in li:
  print s
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight clojure %}
(def myVec [1,2,3])
for ( [x myVec] (println x))
{% endhighlight %}
