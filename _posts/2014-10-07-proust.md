I am reading the first book in Proust's sequence In Search Of Lost Time. One of those monumental lodes of modern literature that has
occupied a place in my mind for years that I've never read. A forbidding mountain of words and art. But now I am submerged. I took a 
deep breath and let myself sink into the words, those long and winding sentences emitted by a sensibility of almost unbearable eloquence and
sophistication. But by page eighty or so, the flow and tide of the French word mass have started to settle and wind their way into my heart and mind. It's everything - time, memory, incredibly vivid and luminous, and connected to every point in the universe. From his cork-lined room, the voice from another world resonates at deep levels on my journey into work every morning, lights up the crevices of urban London, and inflames my thirst for language. I may need to take a break every so often before the density suffocates me, like drinking too much fine wine. But I'll return to the bottle often and when I'm done my very internals will be reworked. Many thanks Marcel.
