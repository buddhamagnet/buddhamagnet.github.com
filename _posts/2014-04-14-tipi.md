This weekend the whole Goodchild crew decided to go wild camping. We settled on
Dernwood Farm in East Sussez after several online recommendations. A beautiful farm
tucked down a country road in lush green hills. Logs, kindling and meat for sale
in the farm shop. Trolleys and wheelbarrows on hand to assist with lugging your
gear the ten minute trundle through wild woods of ash and hazel. And a great
level field surrounded on all four sides by bluebell-drenched forest. An amazing
location and very quiet at this time of year.

And a very helpful lady running the show! We turned up after dark, and after
pushing two stacked trolleys through dark woodland, realised we had forgotten the
poles for the second tent. So night one - four people in a one-man bivvi tent. When
we told this sad tale in the farm shop, we were immediately given use of a five
metre bell tent. A huge thing, and quick to put up and bring down. It's on the list!
